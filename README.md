## Features
1. The first tab using pygwalker library, so you can create customizable chart as you  need and save it. You can expect all pygwalker features available in this web app.

3. The second tab using sweeviz library, so the web app will automatically generate EDA report and you can download the result as html directly.

This web app has limitation with the hosting engine, so I didn't add other library as additional feature. But if you need for deeper EDA, you can use the notebook version in this repository and run it via google colab.
